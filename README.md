https://zhiz-m.github.io/3D-tetris/

This is a fairly simple 3D tetris game that I designed in Year 10 of high school for my Personal Project. It was possibly my first major coding project, and I recovered the original source code when I was going through my old hard drive (nearly 4 years later!). 

The layout of the project is extremely simple, with only 3 files (CSS, HTML and Javascript). The code is unmodified from when my project was finalised in 2017.
